Absolutely! Here’s the list again, with very simple comments like I’m explaining to a 7-year-old:

---

### Setup & Config

---

### Basic Snapshot

* `git status`
  *Ask: What has changed?*

  *Pick a file to save next time.*

* `git add .`
  *Pick all changed files to save next time.*

* `git commit -m "msg"`
  *Put your picked files into a safe place with a note.*

* `git log`
  *Look at the list of all your saved notes.*

---

### Branching

* `git branch`
  *Show all your project versions.* ****

* `git branch <name>`
  *Make a new project version.*

* `git checkout <name>`
  *Go play with a different project version.*

* `git checkout -b <name>`
  *Make a new version and start playing with it.*

* `git merge <name>`
  *Bring changes from one version back to the one you’re playing.*

---

### Remote

* `git remote -v`
  *Show places where your project is saved online.*

* `git pull`
  *Get the newest changes from the online place.*

---

### Undo

---

### Stash
